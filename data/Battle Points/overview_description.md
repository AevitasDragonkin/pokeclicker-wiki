## Formulas
#### Earnings
$$ \text{Battle Points} =\text{Stage Beaten} \times \text{Battle Multiplier} $$
$$ \text{Battle Multiplier} = \max \bigg( \frac{stageBeaten}{100},1 \bigg) $$

**Number of Pokemon Defeated** is equivalent to the number of Pokemon that would be defeated on a particular route by only Pok√©mon damage.
**Route Money** is a route specific constant.

For reference, here is an example of 5 minute intervals, presuming you have beaten them previously (half time), and it takes 1 attack to beat the pokemon (1.5s per Stage).

| Stage | Points | Time | Points per minute |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 100     | 100     | 2m 30s     | 40 ppm |
| 200     | 400     | 5m 0s    | 80 ppm |
| 400     | 1600     | 10m 0s    | 160 ppm |
| 600     | 3600     | 15m 0s    | 240 ppm |
| 800     | 6400     | 20m 0s    | 320 ppm |
| 1000     | 10000     | 25m 0s    | 400 ppm |
| 1200     | 14400     | 30m 0s    | 480 ppm |

With ~10 million Attack, up to ~stage 350 can be completed, netting ~1200 battle points.
