## Acquisition
The Charti berry can be mutated by equipping the [[Items/Cell Battery]] while there is a ripe [[Berries/Cornn]] berry in the [[Farm]]. The Cornn berry will mutate into a Charti berry.

If the "No Oak Items" challenge is on, the Charti berry can be bought from the Johto Berry Master for 10,000 Farm Points.
