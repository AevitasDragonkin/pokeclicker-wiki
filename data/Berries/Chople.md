## Acquisition

The Chople berry can be acquired by equipping the [[Items/Blaze Cassette]] while there is a ripe [[Berries/Spelon]] on the field. The Spelon will then have a chance to mutate into Chople.

If the "No Oak Items" challenge is on, the Chople berry can be bought from the Johto Berry Master for 10,000 Farm Points.
