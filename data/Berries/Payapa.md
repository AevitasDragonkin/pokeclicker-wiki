## Acquisition

The Payapa berry can be acquired by surrounding a plot with a [[Wiki]] berry, a [[Cornn]] berry, a [[Bluk]] berry, and a [[Pamtre]] berry.

Below is a sample farm. Note that Pamtre will mutate into [[Kebia]] with the [[Rocky Helmet]] equipped, and Cornn will mutate into [[Charti]] with the [[Cell Battery]] equipped.
