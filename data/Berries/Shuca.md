## Acquisition
The Shuca berry can be acquired by equipping the [[Items/Sprinklotad]] while there is a ripe [[Berries/Watmel]] berry on the farm. The Watmel berry will then have a chance to mutated into a Shuca berry.

If the "No Oak Items" challenge is on, Shuca can be bought from the Johto Berry Master for 10,000 farm points, as long as the player has unlocked Watmel.
