## Helpful Tips*

The Gems you get from defeating a Pokémon depend on the type(s) that Pokémon has. Wild Pokémon on routes give 1 Gem per type, dungeon encounters (both wild Pokémon and trainers) give 3, gym Pokémon give 5, and dungeon bosses (only Pokémon, not trainer bosses) give 20. Battle Frontier Pokémon give gems which number increases as the player progresses further (every 80 stages the number goes up by 1).

Note: Gyms yield 5 Gems per Pokémon, but not every pokemon in a gym will be the appropriate type. The most efficient gyms yield the most Gems per gym clear.

*(e.g. Violet City Gym is less efficient than the Petalburg City Gym because it takes twice as many clears of the Violet City Gym to obtain the same number of Gems).*
