Regions are areas in the world of Pokémon. Each new region introduces a new set of [[Routes]], [[Towns]], [[Gyms]] and [[Pokémon]]. Pokémon that are not native to a region get a damage debuff, but with each new region entered, this debuff decreases by 10%. Furthermore, some region offer unique gameplay elements.
