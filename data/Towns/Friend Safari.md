## Encounter List
Each day, 5 Pokémon will get randomly chosen, based on the player's trainer ID, which can be checked with the Safari Ranger NPC. Only those Pokémon that **cannot gain EVs in any other place** may show up and only if the player has captured them previously. If the player hasn't, then the Pokémon will show up as a silhouette and cannot be encountered. Even if all daily Pokémon are currently unavailable to the player, Friend Safari has a list of Pokémon that always show up, no matter what. These Pokémon have a lower encounter rate in comparison to the 5 daily ones:
